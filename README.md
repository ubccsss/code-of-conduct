# code-of-conduct

Code of Conduct for CSSS, Cube Lounge/Office, Discord Server, and other CSSS Community Spaces

Rules:

1. This is an Official CSSS Space. Do your part to make the space inclusive and enjoyable for everyone!

2. Treat everyone with kindness and respect. Absolutely no harassment, sexism, racism, intentional prejudice, or hateful/disparaging speech toward any identifiable group, will not be tolerated.

3. Refrain from heated political discussion or comments. We appreciate the importance of constructive political discourse, but this is not the place for all-out debates.

4. When having discussions, challenge someone's ideas, don't attack their character.

5. If you're about to send anything that would ever appear in a Twitter outrage thread, or send anything that you wouldn't say in front of crowded lecture hall, don't.

6. ALL PROVISIONS OF THE UBC STUDENT CODE OF CONDUCT APPLY, regardless of your status as a UBC community member:
